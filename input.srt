00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,580
welcome back to another name tutorial

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
in this tutorial we'll be talking about

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,460
if statements if statements are used to

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,460
add logic to your program you can make

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,019
your program make decisions for example

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,859
when you go to the store and you're like

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,899
hmm

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,520
should I buy

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,399
the bar one

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,440
or the lunch bar

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,180
that's a choice you have to make you can

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,559
even write a program to make that choice

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,420
for you

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,059
and this is where programming really

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,520
starts to become incredibly powerful

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,719
not only to cover all of these in a

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,820
physical manner so I'm just going to

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,500
give them all to you right now so these

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,039
are all the type of operations you can

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,300
do larger than lesser than larger than

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,699
equal

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,880
lesser than or equal

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,520
you also have equal not equal and we'll

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,500
use a few of them to give you an example

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,000
and then finally

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,159
and

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,460
or not

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,140
as well as xor and we'll get into what

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,420
all of these does except for xor this

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,640
basically returns true if one of the

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,200
conditions are false and the other is

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,180
true

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,740
which can be useful if you have a

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,299
scenario for it

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,680
all right so let's declare a few

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,640
variables

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,040
so we have age is equal to 24

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,140
name is equal to Jack

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,960
and birthday

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,720
is equal to true

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,740
cool so we have an integer age a string

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:54,060
Jack and a Boolean yes or no true

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,820
cool now let's say we have a bar now

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,240
let's first say if someone is under the

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,399
age of 21 they are not allowed to enter

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:11,520
this bar then we can check if their age

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,660
is less than 21. then Echo you may not

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,700
enter

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,680
or enter

50
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,780
so here we're checking if this variable

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,760
age is less than 21 we could have even

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,160
put a normal number here like 24 that's

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,239
perfectly fine anyhow so we're checking

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,360
is this less than this if it is Princess

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,099
let's make the age 10 for now

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,040
if we run this

57
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,160
we will get you may not enter

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,400
but if we were to say 21 because this is

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,400
any checking for less than 21. so 21 and

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,519
older is perfectly fine so if we run

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,160
this you'll see we don't get an output

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,280
so just by using an if statement we've

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,920
told our program to only do something if

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,260
it meets a specific condition

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,000
now let's say if someone's too old

66
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,440
they're also not allowed to enter so we

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,319
can say if age

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,580
is more than 60 so if they're older than

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,260
60

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,700
then you should tell them

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,000
Echo

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,800
you are elderly

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,239
may not

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,000
enter

75
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,560
cool so now we have two if statements

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
here and take note of the indentation

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,540
here that's actually important if you

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,180
just do this it might for an error at

79
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,940
you indentation is important

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,340
so you'll also notice here this is not

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,739
part of this top F statement because

82
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,500
there's no indentation here the

83
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,500
indentation and Nim is very important so

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,540
all of this is part of this if statement

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,180
but this is not part of this top if

86
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,760
statement because it is unindicted

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,560
always take note of your indentation if

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,620
you know if you're coming from python

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,900
it's the same concept what is indented

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,220
is important

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,620
all right

92
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,060
so now that we know that that this if

93
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,760
statement does not contain the save

94
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,220
statement they will run independently so

95
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,379
we were to go 20 this bottom one will

96
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,379
execute but not this top one

97
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,700
run it you may not enter

98
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:16,620
and here we will be saying

99
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,299
610 then the top one will execute but

100
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,299
not the bottom one

101
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,040
your elderly may not enter

102
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,540
now let's say if they are not one of

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,460
these two ages

104
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,440
they are allowed to enter because then

105
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,620
you can just say Echo

106
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,259
you may enter

107
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,720
but now we have a problem

108
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,360
we will now have to if we want to make

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,880
this one only executive D's are not true

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,780
we have to Dango if

111
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:50,580
H is more or equal to 21

112
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,160
or age is more equal to 60

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,100
or not more equal but I mean less or

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,860
equal to 60. then you may enter so now

115
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,320
we have three if statements one for if

116
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,320
they're older than 60 one if they're

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,020
younger than 21 and one if they're older

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,400
or the same age as 21

119
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:15,620
or younger or the same age as 60.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,600
if we run this and let's say our guy is

121
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,479
32. now they are allowed to enter

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,580
because they are not older than 60 and

123
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,560
not younger than 21.

124
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,259
so if this or statement here we can

125
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,660
check if this is true

126
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,520
or if this is true and you can use

127
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,100
brackets to make it a little bit easier

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,860
because now you can see this goes first

129
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,300
then this it checks them so if either of

130
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,759
these

131
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,560
is true then this will execute but now

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,780
we have a problem

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,720
what if we were to say they are 302

134
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,880
will actually get your elderly may not

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,860
enter as well as you may enter

136
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,500
because all checks every one of these

137
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,360
two are true not if both are true

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,280
so if this is a True Value but this is a

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,580
false value

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,620
this will still execute because this one

141
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,720
is true so if yes

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,639
or no that's what you're basically

143
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,539
saying here so if either of these two

144
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,360
are yes true then print this out

145
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,500
if we were to say and instead then we'll

146
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,440
say if this is true and if this is true

147
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,080
then execute this so now we were to run

148
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,979
this we'll get your elderly may not

149
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,800
enter

150
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,960
but if we were to say 31 now

151
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,240
then we will not get that we'll just get

152
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,699
you may enter and if we were to make

153
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,520
them 18

154
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,000
then you may not enter cool so we have

155
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,960
just covered larger than larger than or

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,020
equal less than lesser than or equal

157
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,280
and and or

158
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,380
all right

159
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,860
now we can actually make this a little

160
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,520
bit less to work with for example we can

161
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,699
say alif and now these two are one if

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,199
statement but this one checks if this

163
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,600
executes

164
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,060
then this will not execute

165
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,280
if this does not execute then we'll try

166
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,680
and execute this but they cannot both be

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
executed at the same time to give an

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,900
example let's say we have this if

169
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,800
statement

170
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,780
and here we're saying after age

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
is less than

172
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,800
or actually let's go here let's say if

173
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,660
their age is more than 18 right just

174
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,639
ignore this piece of text here and if

175
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,560
your age is less than 21

176
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,500
now if we were to go here and we would

177
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,060
just say 20. so it will fill both of

178
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,620
these categories

179
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,800
we run it

180
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,720
then you get both of these values

181
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
however

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,759
if we were to say

183
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,819
L if which means else if

184
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,759
then only one of them can execute at a

185
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,680
time your elderly may not enter and the

186
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,440
one that executes is the one that gets

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,560
hit first so if we were to say

188
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,380
10. this one will not execute because 10

189
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,660
is less than 18. but this one will

190
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,460
execute so now if we run this you get

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,699
you may not enter

192
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,879
so just as an example that allows us to

193
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,560
have two if statements that does not get

194
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,840
in conflict with each other only one of

195
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,940
those two if statements can run

196
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,520
you can of course have as many else if

197
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,259
statements as you want you don't have

198
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,260
any limits but take note if one of them

199
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,360
gets executed the rest will be ignored

200
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,459
and take note all them should preferably

201
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,399
have a different value so this could be

202
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:46,860
22 23 24 25 and so on and so forth and

203
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,500
didn't all need to check age

204
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,000
one could check age the other one could

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,519
maybe check the name so here we could

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,640
say I'll say if name is equal to

207
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,620
Mike then you may not enter and that's

208
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,000
the wrong equal there that should be two

209
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,040
equals

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,980
I will get into that in a second

211
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,140
okay so now that we know that we can

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,000
actually use this to our advantage

213
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,459
now we have this if statement here at

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,320
the bottom the problem with this if

215
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,600
statement is every time we want to add

216
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,279
another check here we have to add it

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,500
here as well

218
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,080
but because if statements are so

219
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,560
powerful we can add in else statement at

220
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,320
the end remove this and there we go

221
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,720
now it's all one big if statement else

222
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,480
will execute and none of its upper

223
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,940
components executed so if you have a

224
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,040
hundred else if statements here if none

225
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,800
of them execute then else will execute

226
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,800
at the very end however if one of these

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,800
else ifs execute or if this if execute

228
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,000
else will not execute so this will only

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,080
execute

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,120
only run if

231
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,380
none of the other

232
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,320
if

233
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,920
or L if ran

234
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,880
so this and this did not run then run

235
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,540
else but if this ran skip these if this

236
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,120
ran skip this and skip this all right

237
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:16,740
now if you run this we'll get you may

238
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:20,880
not enter if we make them 39 they may

239
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,140
enter if you make them 90 they may not

240
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,600
enter

241
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,180
so it's basically what we had but now

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,920
there's less checks and we didn't have

243
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,899
to worry that one if statement will

244
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,580
execute when another should not be

245
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,500
executing because this one has already

246
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,680
executed

247
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,899
it's the same as getting else and then

248
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,660
doing this

249
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,540
instead of having to indent this and do

250
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,180
this we can just do this and I will make

251
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,579
it easier on us as well now let's say we

252
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,940
want to do a few extra checks here let's

253
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,680
say if they may enter you will want to

254
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,660
go

255
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:05,579
if name is equal to Jack

256
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:08,579
then 20 off all drinks

257
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:10,920
and we'll take this

258
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,019
so we're checking if their name is equal

259
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,579
to Jack do this

260
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,800
and then also do this because you have

261
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:19,200
to remember if something is not part of

262
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,940
an if statement it will still execute if

263
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,440
I go here let's say

264
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,220
echo1

265
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:29,880
and then I'll go here and say echo2 we

266
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,740
will always see echo1 and Echo 2. no

267
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,660
matter what this if statement says we

268
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,440
will always see this because these are

269
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,260
not part of the if statement

270
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,420
same applies here because this Echo is

271
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,519
not part of this if state if it wants to

272
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,440
be it needs to be indented

273
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,959
because this here is its own little

274
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,579
block scope same with this this is its

275
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,279
own block scope so if we were to go like

276
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,899
this then now this will be part of this

277
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,540
if statement and this if statement is

278
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,980
part of this else statement but they are

279
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,380
not part of this core code here

280
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,200
indentation is very important again

281
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,140
because this indentation says if

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,540
something is part of something else

283
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:16,140
this also shows you you can have an if

284
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,079
statement inside of another if statement

285
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,620
even up here we could say

286
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,880
if name is equal to Jack this could be a

287
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,200
special case

288
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,579
and then

289
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
Echo

290
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,779
you may

291
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,380
enter

292
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:36,420
you are a good customer there we go

293
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,640
so you can have an if statement within

294
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,040
another if statement now if we were to

295
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,200
run this we will get you may enter you

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,360
are a good customer and we'll still get

297
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,019
2 here because 2 and we'll just resize

298
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,940
this because 2 is still part of the

299
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,459
normal code it's not part of this if

300
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,139
statement if you were to indent it it

301
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,279
will be part of the if statement and it

302
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,200
will not run

303
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,480
all right but you'll notice we still get

304
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,700
your elderly may not enter

305
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,339
what we want to do here maybe is we

306
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,440
could say if name

307
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,120
okay so let's try adding a nautical if

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,680
it's not equal to Jack

309
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
Echo this

310
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,240
else this

311
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,459
so we have an if else in here of course

312
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,959
you could have said equals Jack

313
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,720
and you could do this

314
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,300
so this is if the name is Jack do this

315
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,940
but you could also do not equal so the

316
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,399
name is not equal to Jack do this and

317
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,760
take note of this equal symbol here

318
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,500
this is two equal symbols not one one

319
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,040
will reassign

320
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,899
two will check conditions this is a very

321
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,940
important distinction to make

322
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,800
now if we run this we get you may enter

323
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,959
you are a good customer

324
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,820
and in here we could say

325
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,320
let's say their name was

326
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,459
AC

327
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,040
then they say your elderly may not enter

328
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,360
let's say your name was Jack and they

329
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,540
were

330
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,820
38 so they are allowed to enter

331
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,740
then 30 percent of all drinks and you

332
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,380
may enter we might want to put the human

333
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,420
inter first and then say 20 off of all

334
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,160
drinks just to make it look like there's

335
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,260
actually some order here

336
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,579
if you run this then it will display in

337
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,320
that order

338
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,540
and if their name was not jacked they

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,300
will not receive that message to run

340
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,620
this you may enter but not 20 of all

341
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,540
drinks

342
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,500
now let's say if it's someone's birthday

343
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,620
they also get 20 percent of drinks

344
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,240
well if that is the case then we could

345
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,720
say

346
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,519
or birthday is equal to true

347
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,600
so now we're checking is their name Jack

348
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,760
or is their birthday today if it is then

349
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,320
print this so this is again an example

350
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,959
of an or statement

351
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,899
with this Boolean statement here we can

352
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,399
actually just go like this this means if

353
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,380
their name is Jack or if it's their

354
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,339
birthday because this is already true or

355
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,740
false

356
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,779
because going like this

357
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,120
is the same as not having that there

358
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,380
because it will still check if this is a

359
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,360
true value

360
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,260
so you can also do if it's not equal to

361
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,279
true

362
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:14,820
or if it is equal to false

363
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,000
or you could go or not birthday

364
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,740
not here tells us if this is a false

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,320
value then it will be represented as

366
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,279
true if you were to open up an M secret

367
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,560
here

368
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,160
which is a little command line and we

369
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,680
would say let X is equal to true

370
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,420
X is a true Boolean

371
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,380
not

372
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,480
X is false because if something is not

373
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,199
true it is false

374
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,060
not not X would be true because if

375
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,540
something because first here this is

376
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,060
true if it's not true it's false if it's

377
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,880
not false it's true

378
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,860
so not will allow us to flip it around

379
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,600
so if it's true it becomes false if it's

380
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,360
false it becomes true

381
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,180
all right so if your name is Jack or if

382
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,620
it's not their birthday they get 30 off

383
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,639
something you might want to take a look

384
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,079
at

385
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,839
now let's say

386
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,760
the name should either be Jack

387
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
or it's their birthday but they cannot

388
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,519
be both

389
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,260
so if I say xor birthday then it either

390
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,940
has to be their birthday or their name

391
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,519
should be Jack but if their name is Jack

392
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,839
and it's their birthday they are not

393
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,000
allowed to have a drink

394
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,279
but if it's their birthday

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,139
and their name is not Jack they are

396
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,699
allowed to have a drink for 20 off if

397
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,199
their name is Jack but it's not their

398
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,899
birthday they're allowed time to drive

399
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,699
for 20 percent off if you run this we'll

400
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,220
get what we expect

401
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,720
three percent of all drinks but if we

402
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,660
were to make their birthday false

403
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
meaning both of these will be false

404
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,720
then you may enter it will not execute

405
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,880
this

406
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,339
but if your name was Jack they will get

407
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,620
20 off their drinks but if their name is

408
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,519
Jack and it's their birthday

409
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,560
then they will not get 20 off all drinks

410
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
now let's say we check if it's their

411
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,559
birthday

412
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,740
and

413
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,380
if your name is equal to

414
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,020
Jack

415
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,419
or their age is more than 30. now this

416
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,319
is a little bit confusing because with

417
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:21,780
python or what Nim will do here

418
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,419
is Nim will first check is it your

419
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,160
birthday if this is true they will try

420
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,919
and check is their name equal to check

421
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,200
as well if this is true that if this is

422
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:35,100
true or this is true that's what Nim

423
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,559
will do so Nim will basically first run

424
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,860
this statement here the first statement

425
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:43,500
it sees so if this is true or if this is

426
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,720
true but in our case let's say we don't

427
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,299
care about this we just want to check

428
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,059
this and I will check if it's their

429
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,760
birthday and their name is Jack or their

430
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,960
age is more than 30. then it will Echo

431
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,179
this

432
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,100
but by default it will not do that so

433
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,039
you will need to use brackets to specify

434
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,520
what you want to be checked first if you

435
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,200
run this we get SAS because this

436
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,600
executed as true

437
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,700
cool now one more thing is you might

438
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,960
want to turn aerator operator

439
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,640
so let's go let's greet is equal to if

440
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,620
birthday

441
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,900
so if it's their birthday

442
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,280
then greed becomes happy birth day

443
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,600
else

444
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,760
welcome

445
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,440
so internet radio operator is when you

446
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,679
have this if statement but it's in one

447
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,600
line and returns a value in this case we

448
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,039
could have gone

449
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,320
VAR great is equal to welcome and then

450
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:48,780
we could have gone if

451
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:51,419
birthday then greet is equal to

452
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,820
happy birthday

453
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,700
we could have done this but as you see

454
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,559
now greed needs to be Evar

455
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,299
which you don't necessarily want you

456
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,419
might be like me and you want to stick

457
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:06,179
with lit as most match as possible

458
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,039
so first greed has to be a war plus this

459
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,960
takes up four lines including the

460
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,120
spacers but it could take a free

461
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,380
but this takes up four lines instead of

462
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,000
one line

463
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,220
and this actually might be a little bit

464
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,360
more difficult to read than this inline

465
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,400
if statement

466
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,919
so you might actually see more use in

467
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,679
having this turnario operator around

468
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,320
then using a normal if statement but

469
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,900
this is up to you if you prefer to use a

470
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,940
ternary operator above a normal if

471
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,220
statement then use it just don't go too

472
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,200
overboard because they become very

473
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,539
difficult to read very fast but with

474
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,520
Basics scenarios like this it is one of

475
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:43,679
the best things in the world and now we

476
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,919
get happy birthday able to make this

477
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,240
false we will get welcome

478
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,220
cool

479
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,620
and that's the basics on if statement

480
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,760
quite a lot to cover quite a lot to

481
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,679
remember

482
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,440
but I hope you all enjoyed and I will

483
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,100
see you all again in the next Nim

484
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,100
